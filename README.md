# 🔢 Logic Gate Calculator

An interactive calculator web application that visualizes binary operations through animated logic gates using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## ✨ Features

### �� Calculator Functionality
- **Decimal Input**: Enter two decimal numbers
- **Multiple Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant results with binary operation visualization

### 🧠 Logic Gate Animation
- **Step-by-step Visualization**: See how each binary operation is performed
- **Animated Logic Gates**: AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates with visual feedback
- **Binary Representation**: Real-time conversion between decimal and binary
- **Gate Highlighting**: Active gates glow and animate during operations

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion powered transitions
- **Beautiful Interface**: Modern design with Tailwind CSS
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar during calculations

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter two decimal numbers (e.g., 6 and 3)
2. **Operation**: Select an operation (+, -, ×, ÷)
3. **Calculate**: Click the calculate button
4. **Animation**: Watch the binary magic happen:
   - Numbers convert to binary (6 → 0110, 3 → 0011)
   - Logic gates process the operation step by step
   - See AND, OR, XOR gates in action
   - Final binary result converts back to decimal

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict mode

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎓 Educational Value
